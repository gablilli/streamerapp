Stremio is a modern media center that gives you the freedom to watch everything you want. it has a lot of great addons and plugins. Streamer can use the same addons to enhance your streaming experience.
This is a Streamer Pro feature. 

## How to install Stremio Addon on Streamer

1. Navigate to [Stremio Addon Catalog](https://stremio-addons.netlify.app) to browse through the available addons.
2. Find the addon you wish to install and click on 'Configure' or 'Install'.
